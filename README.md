Makes angles of handles the same as the lines that precede or come after them. Good for dekinking bracketed serifs on oblique strokes, and other curves.

It Only changes the handle if:
1. the line that precedes or comes after it is not vertical or horizontal
2. the line that precedes or comes after it is longer than 75% of the handle's lenght
3. the angle of the handle differs in less then 3Â° from the angle of the line

Only changes BCP's. Doesn't change nodes.
