Makes angles of handles the same as the lines that precede or come after them. Good for dekinking bracketed serifs on oblique strokes, and other curves.

It Only changes the handle if:
1. the line that precedes or comes after it is longer than 75% of the handle's lenght
1. The node with the handle is "round" or the angles of the Handle and Line differ less then 5Â°

Only changes BCP's. Doesn't change nodes.
