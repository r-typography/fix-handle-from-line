Makes angles of handles the same as the lines that precede or come after them. Good for dekinking bracketed serifs on oblique strokes, and other curves.

It Only changes the handle if:
1. the line that precedes or comes after is not vertical or horizontal
2. the line that precedes or comes after is longer than the handle
3. the node that connects the line to the curve is "round"

Only changes BCP's. Doesn't change nodes.
