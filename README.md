Makes angles of handles the same as the lines that precede or come after them. Good for dekinking bracketed serifs on oblique strokes, and other curves.

It Only changes the handle if:
1. the line that precedes or comes after it is not vertical or horizontal
2. the line that precedes or comes after it is longer than 75% of the handle's lenght
3. The node with the handle must be "round"

Only changes BCP's. Doesn't change nodes.
